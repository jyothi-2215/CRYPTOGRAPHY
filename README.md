This project explores classical encryption techniques in cryptography using fundamental mathematical concepts from number theory. 
It covers the design, encryption, and decryption mechanisms of multiple cipher algorithms — including Affine, Hill, Shift (Caesar), 
Substitution, Transposition, and Vigenère ciphers. The objective is to understand how each method secures data through mathematical 
transformations, analyze their vulnerabilities, and compare their effectiveness in maintaining message confidentiality
