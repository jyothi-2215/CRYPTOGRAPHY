##  Project Description

This project explores **classical encryption techniques** in cryptography using fundamental mathematical concepts from **number theory**.  
It covers the design, encryption, and decryption mechanisms of multiple cipher algorithms — including **Affine**, **Hill**, **Shift (Caesar)**, **Substitution**, **Transposition**, and **Vigenère** ciphers.  

The objective is to:
- Understand how each method secures data through mathematical transformations.  
- Analyze their vulnerabilities and strengths.  
- Compare their effectiveness in maintaining message confidentiality.
